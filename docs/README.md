Fortran is used a lot in the context of HPC.  For many, it has a
reputation of being an old and ugly programming language.  However,
modern Fortran is a far cry from Fortran 77 that its detractors have
in mind.  Fortran 2003/2008 is a language that is well tailored
towards scientific computing.  This training introduces the language
and its features.

# Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * read and understand well-written Fortran code;
  * write intermediate-level Fortran programs;
  * have a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the more
    sophisticated aspects of Fortran by practicing.
  * know about best practices and pitfalls for Fortran programmers.

# Content

  * basics: control flow statements, data types, functions
  * arrays and pointers
  * user defined types/classes
  * procedures
  * modules
  * file I/O
  * command line interaction

Slides are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/FortranForProgrammers),
as well as example code and exercises.

# Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Fortran as a programming
language.


# Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in another programming language,
This is not a training that starts from scratch.
